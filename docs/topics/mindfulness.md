_Don't do something. Just sit there._

The aim of mindfulness is to be fully occupied with what is happening in the present moment. This has been found to be very healing.

Depending on what kind of mind you have, it can be hard to get your attention away from the churn of thoughts and place attention, instead, on the quieter things that are also happening in the moment. There's your breathing, any tingling sensations in your limbs, your heartbeat. There's the way light is falling on the objects around you. The sounds as they come and go. All these things are less entertaining than our thoughts, but they don't trigger our responses in the way thoughts do. They are not addictive in the way that thougts are. This is a relief. Our nervous systems can settle and calm. Our emotional reactions become quieter. The breathing slows. The heart gets a break.

After the thrill of a funfair ride you would ruin your evening if you wanted everything else to be that exciting. You accept that what comes next - walking back to the car, driving home, doing the dishes - won't be as gripping. And that's OK. Those other things are interesting too, but at a calmer level. When we practice mindfulness we turn away from the fascinating stories our minds are spinning. Instead we fill our attention with the smaller, quieter things that are taking place right now.

### If you want to experiment with mindfulness

<div class="indent">

1. Make time in a safe, quiet place where you won't be disturbed.
1. Posture supports practice. Use the posture instructions for [Alexander Technique](alexander-technique).
1. We're not trying to change anything, get anywhere, or have any particular experience. Notice any expectations like that and put them aside as best you can.
1. Pay close attention to something happening now -
   - either in your body. There are always sensations coming and going in your body (breathing, heartbeat, tingling)
   - or in the environment (noises, the way the light is falling in the space)
1. Pick one thing to focus on and keep noticing its changes, moment to moment.
1. Get really interested in the micro-changes. Find a way of enjoying them.
1. When you notice your attention has been captured by thoughts, GENTLY return it to your chosen focus.
1. You'll probably notice that nothing remarkable is happening - just the ho-hum background stuff that is normally too subtle to make it into our awareness.
1. Hopefully your nervous system will calm down by itself.
1. When you are ready to stop, say 'Thank you' to yourself for giving you these quiet moments.

How did you get on? Even if you only did step 1, that can be really helpful (see [How to change](change)). Regular practice will help you understand what is on offer here. It is not thrills and excitement! Regular practititioners say that instead of feeling 'scattered' there is a sense of being 'settled, collected'. The health benefits are well researched.

Mindfulness can be difficult -

- depending on what kind of mind you have, the thoughts may keep coming. You try and you find you can't stop them. This is perfectly normal for most of us. It is called the 'monkey mind': it's nature is to be continually chattering. It is very easy, then, to get discouraged and give up mindfulness. My mind is one of those and I've been practicing on and off for x years.
- when we drop back from the preoccupations that habitually fill our head space, we can find that other things come into our attention. You become aware of things about yourself you hadn't been noticing. You may discover you are more tired than you realised: good - you now know you need more rest. One of the benefits of mindfulness is that it puts you in touch with yourself. You may discover you are upset or hurt by something: good - you can sit quietly and listen/feel as you learn about your own response.

::: danger Health warning
Our minds protect us from [trauma](trauma) by masking its effects. Masking is a survival mechanism. If your nervous system is masking then it is protecting you. If you try mindfulness and you start experiencing flashbacks you may decide mindfulness is not for you at this time. Masking can be gently dissassembled, but this is best done with help of a therapist.
If you want to continue, keep stepping away from the power of the past and coming back to the present moment. Use present moment sensations as a safe refuge. It is not therapeutic to re-traumatise your nervous system so be sure that this won't happen. See [trauma](trauma) for more detail.
