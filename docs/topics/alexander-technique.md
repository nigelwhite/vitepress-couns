### Experiment with mindfulness

1. Make time in a safe, quiet place where you won't be disturbed.
2. Sit upright on a firm surface, eg a dining chair with thin padding.
3. Your spine is supported at the hips by the chair and your muscles are keeping the spine in balance, being free of the chair back
